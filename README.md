## Features üåü

- **Trello Integration**: Direct interaction with the Trello API for seamless card, list, and label management.
- **Topic-based Categorization**: Challenges are grouped under topics like Arrays, Two Pointers, Binary Trees, etc., for a comprehensive study approach.
- **Automated Due Dates**: Assigns due dates to challenges, offering a structured study plan.
- **Direct Challenge Links**: Each card contains a direct link to the respective LeetCode challenge for easy access.
- **Customizability**: Modify the script to adapt to individual study plans or different challenge sets.

## Spaced Repetition Learning üß†üîÑ

One of the core principles that influenced the design of this scheduler is the concept of **Spaced Repetition**. It's a scientifically-backed learning technique where information is reviewed at increasing intervals, ensuring long-term retention and efficient learning. By spacing out your LeetCode challenges, you're not just practicing but also reinforcing your memory and understanding of algorithms and data structures.

### Why Spaced Repetition?

- **Enhanced Retention**: It reduces the forgetting curve, ensuring that you remember algorithms and solutions for a longer duration.
- **Efficient Learning**: Instead of cramming, spaced repetition promotes steady, incremental learning, which is proven to be more effective.
- **Adaptive**: The technique adjusts to your learning pace. Topics you're familiar with will appear less often, while challenging ones will be reviewed more frequently.

### How It Works:

1. **Weekly Challenges**: 
   - Each week, the scheduler ensures that the 'To Do this Week' list contains the required number of cards, as defined in the settings. 
   - Some cards, based on specific labels, are exempt from this count.

2. **Retrospective Processing**: 
   - Cards in the 'Retrospective' list are periodically processed. 
   - Their due dates and positions are adjusted based on their associated labels:
     - **Do not know**: The challenge is scheduled for the next working day in the 'Do this week' list.
     - **Somewhat know**: The challenge is scheduled for a week later. Depending on the new due date, it might remain in the 'Do this week' list or be moved to the 'Backlog'.
     - **Know**: The challenge is deemed completed and is scheduled for a review four weeks later in the 'Completed' list.

3. **Backlog Management**: 
   - If there's a shortfall in the 'To Do this Week' list, cards from the 'Backlog' are promoted to fill the gap.

## Retrospective Review üìù

After tackling each LeetCode challenge during the week, setting aside time to introspect on your comprehension is pivotal. We've introduced a structured comment to aid this self-assessment, guiding you through:

- **Problem Understanding**: Reevaluate your grasp of the challenge.
- **Solution Strategy**: Deliberate on your chosen methodologies.
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Consider the performance and robustness of your solution.
- **Code Implementation**: Reflect on the coding phase, noting any challenges or revelations.
- **Test Depth**: Gauge the comprehensiveness of your tests and consideration of edge cases.
- **Learning Takeaways**: Identify any new algorithms or concepts you encountered.
- **Solution Benchmarking**: Compare your method with alternatives in terms of simplicity and efficiency.
- **Future Adaptations**: Think about potential variations of the problem and how you'd adapt your strategy.

### Review Process:


1. **Card Movement**: After your self-assessment, manually move the challenge card from the 'To Do this Week' list to the 'Retrospective' list on Trello. (Will update this to move automatically in future)
2. **Label Assignment**: Within the 'Retrospective' list, apply one of the following labels to the card based on your understanding:
   - **Know**: You feel confident about your grasp and solution.
   - **Somewhat Know**: You understand the basics but had certain uncertainties.
   - **Do Not Know**: You found the challenge particularly tough and had difficulties.

### Spaced Repetition Integration:

Once you've labeled your challenges in the 'Retrospective' list:

1. **Pipeline Execution**: 
   - **Manual Trigger**: If you wish to see the changes reflected immediately, navigate to the `Actions` tab of your GitHub repository, select the appropriate workflow, and manually trigger the pipeline.
   - **Scheduled Run**: Alternatively, if you prefer to wait, the pipeline is set to run automatically at 01:00 UTC every Monday.
2. **Label-Based Scheduling**: 
   - **Know**: Challenges labeled as "Know" are scheduled for infrequent reviews, ensuring you're revisiting them just enough to retain your understanding.
   - **Somewhat Know**: These challenges are scheduled for moderate frequency, allowing you to reinforce and solidify your understanding over time.
   - **Do Not Know**: Challenges with this label are set for more frequent reviews, ensuring you get ample practice until you're confident.


## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Obtain API Key from Trello:

- **Login**: Ensure you're logged into your [Trello account](https://trello.com/).
- **Developer Portal**: Navigate to the [Power-Up Admin Portal](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/).
- **API Key**: View and manage your developer API keys. If you haven't created one, add a new one. Once created, copy and safely store your API key.
